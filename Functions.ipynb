        "1. Lazy Evaluation (Yielding): Instead of calculating all the values and returning them as a single list, a generator yields one value at a time and then pauses its execution.\n",
        "2. State Preservation: When the generator yields a value, the function's entire state (including the values of local variables and where the execution left off) is saved. When next() is called again, execution resumes exactly where it stopped.\n",

        "- Generators produce items one at a time, on-demand, rather than building an entire list (or other container) in memory all at once.\n",
        "- This is particularly important when working with large data sets, streams, or potentially infinite sequences.\n",
        "2. Improved performance / responsiveness:\n",
        "- Because items are generated lazily, you can begin processing the first outputs immediately without waiting for the entire result to be computed.\n",
        "- If you only need part of the output (e.g., first N items), you don’t waste time or memory generating the rest.\n",
        "3. Simpler code for iteration logic / state retention:\n",
        "- Generators naturally maintain their execution state (locals, control flow) between yields — you don’t need to write an explicit iterator class with __iter__() and __next__().\n",
        "- The yield syntax often leads to cleaner, more readable code when the task is to “produce a sequence” rather than “compute and return a fixed result list”.\n",
        "4. Ability to represent infinite or very large sequences:\n",
        "- Since generators don’t require storing all results ahead of time, they’re well suited for infinite loops or streams (e.g., reading lines from a large file, or producing a never-ending series).\n",
        "\n",
        "     When a regular function might be better:\n",
        "\n",

        "- A generator can only be “used” once: once you consume the values, they’re gone (unless you recreate the generator).\n",
